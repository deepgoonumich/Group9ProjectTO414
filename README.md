#### Deep
1. Did some basic data cleaning
2. Did basic data exploration
3. Created the following very basic models (their accuracies are next to them in the rmd file)
a. Logit
b. Linear 
c. KNN
d. ANN
e. SVM

### Summary and tasks ahead
KNN Model seems to have a very high accuracy so we should discuss that with the professor
Other models are very basic and their accuracies need to be improved
