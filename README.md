# Group9ProjectTO414
Code base for group9's final project TO414


# Add Work and updates according to date 

## Wednesday April 8 2020

#### Deep
1. Did some basic data cleaning
2. Did basic data exploration
3. Created the following very basic models (their accuracies are next to them in the rmd file)
a. Logit
b. Linear 
c. KNN
d. ANN
e. SVM

### Summary and tasks ahead
KNN Model seems to have a very high accuracy so we should discuss that with the professor
Other models are very basic and their accuracies need to be improved

## Wednesday April 15 2020

#### Deep
1. Did more data cleaning
2. Improved all models except Logistic, I worked on it but it still has some issues. Should go to office hours
3. All other models ready to go
4. Built decision tree and random forest, also ready to go

### Summary and tasks ahead
KNN Model seems to have a very high accuracy so we should discuss that with the professor
Logistic models have some issues
Highest accuracy achieved by all models is capping out ~77%
Other models are very basic and their accuracies need to be improved

To Do:
1. Some basic charts and visualization on data exploration part
2. Analyze and write findings
3. Use improve model code from class and build a model that does best of all.
